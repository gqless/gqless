## All scalars can be undefined?

For `gqless` to be able to work, in the first pass of your data usage, every GraphQL [Scalar](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types) and [Enum](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#enumeration-types) is returned as `undefined`,
after that, the data requirement is acknowledged by `gqless`, and when the data arrives from the GraphQL API, it returns the new value instead.

We will often call them `Skeleton value`.

One important thing to note is that the **_"Skeleton value"_** is different than `null` _(which was used in the early designs)_,
which allows you differentiate between when it's a "Skeleton value" or an actual `null` coming from the API, and it also allows you to easily set default values to replace **only** the "Skeleton value" while [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

## How will it affect bundle size?

In the code-generated files, an object representation of the schema is outputted - negligible for most apps. This could be optimized in the future by stripping out unused parts.

The gqless packages are lightweight and don't require external dependencies.

## How fast is it?

Very fast, gqless's architecture was designed with performance in mind. Unlike other clients, queries are generated directly - instead of outputting intermediate AST.
