## Cache

- Support for Keys
  - Support for circular references
- Support for partial merging

## Optimizations

- Heavily reduced cost of merging to cache
- Extension instances are now shared
- Internal lazy intialized & memoized changes

## Regressions

- Fragments need to be rewired, currently don't work
