The Core Client has some configurations you can set manually:

```ts
createClient<GeneratedSchema, SchemaObjectTypesNames, SchemaObjectTypes>({
  // Required configuration
  schema: generatedSchema,
  scalarsEnumsHash,
  queryFetcher,

  // Optional configurable options

  catchSelectionsTimeMS: 10,
  retry: true,
  normalization: true,
  subscriptionsClient,
});
```

## `ClientOptions`

## `RetryOptions`

By default GQless has a retry policy of `3` max retries, with a delay of a standard back-off delay `(attemptIndex) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000)` ms.

You can customize it this way:

- `retry = false` to disable it.
- `retry = 6` it will retry failing requests `6` times, with the standard back-off delay.
- `retry = true` to use the default `3` max retries, with a delay of standard, a back-off delay.
- `{ maxRetries: 6, retryDelay: 2000 }` for `6` max retries, with flat 2000ms of delay per retry.
- `{ retryDelay: function customRetryDelay(attemptIndex) { ... } }` for `3` max retries with custom back-off delay, and so on...

## Normalization

GQless has support for normalization, which helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity across all the cache.

It is `enabled` by default, but you can disable it, which will disable the need of automatically fetching `__typename` and `id's` and all the computing logic needed to support it.

```ts
createClient<GeneratedSchema, SchemaObjectTypes, SchemaObjectTypesNames>({
  // ...
  normalization: false,
});
```

But often enough, it's very useful, and keep in mind that `Normalization` in GQless is highly customizable:

### Identifier

You can specify a custom object identifier function.

It gives an incoming object with it's `__typename` and it should return:

- A **string** if successfully identified
- '**null**' if it shouldn't be normalized
- Or '**undefined**', to fallback to either default or custom [`keyFields`](#keyfields)

```ts
createClient<GeneratedSchema, SchemaObjectTypes, SchemaObjectTypesNames>({
  // ...
  normalization: {
    identifier(obj) {
      switch (obj.__typename) {
        case 'User': {
          if (obj.email) {
            return `${obj.__typename}${obj.email}`;
          }
          return null;
        }
        default: {
          return;
        }
      }
    },
  },
});
```

### keyFields

Auto-fetch & object identifier customization.

> Keep in mind that GQless already checks your schema and looks for the fields **id** or **\_\_id**
> and it add thems **automatically**.

Set custom **id's** of any object type in your schema.

**IMPORTANT**: Please make sure to only put [`Scalars`](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/#scalar-types)
without any variable needed as `keyFields`

```ts
createClient<GeneratedSchema, SchemaObjectTypes, SchemaObjectTypesNames>({
  // ...
  normalization: {
    keyFields: {
      User: ['email'],
    },
  },
});
```
