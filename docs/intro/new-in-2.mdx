title: What's new in 2.0

Mutations, subscriptions and new hooks for React make lazy loading, suspense, and other patterns much easier.
Here's a breakdown of what's changed:

## Improved performance

### Client-side

Runtime speed has been dramatically increased, fetching data now scales much better - the largest queries will see the greatest benefit. The schema format has been simplified.

### Build-time

Types are now generated differently. You should see significant gains in TypeScript compiler performance.

## Mutations

Support for [mutations](/client/mutations) has been added. They work very similarly to queries, using the `mutation` object instead.

## Subscriptions

Support for [subscriptions](/client/subscriptions) is now here. You can build realtime user interfaces with GQless now.

## Caching strategies and fetch policies

Theres new support for caching strategies and [persistence](/client/persistence), that allow your queries to retrieve previously fetched data. It supports the `stale-while-revalidate` pattern
as well as `cache-and-network`, `cache-first`, `network-only` and `no-cache` policies, and lets you configure how you want your cache to persist for cross-session persistence.

[**Normalized caching**](/client/config#normalization) has also been improved.

## Server-side Rendering

Server-Side rendering (**SSR**) is now supported, which works great with Next.js. See [React SSR](/react/ssr) for more

## React Hooks

The [`useQuery` hook](/react/fetching-data) has been added, which you can use in replacement of the HoC

The [new hooks](/react/fetching-data) include:

- `useTransactionQuery`: Giving you access to loading state, polling, and more.
- `useLazyQuery`: A query that can be triggered conditionally.
- `useRefetch`: A hook that works alongside regular useQuery, letting your programatically make it refetch.
- `useMutation`: More control over mutations with loading states.
- `useSubscription`: Likewise, a hook for subscriptions.
- `useMetaState`: Lets you hook into the fetch state of gqless and output errors.
- `useHydrateCache`: For restoring SSR state to the client.

And the new helpers functions:

- `prepareQuery`: Extract queries above components, letting you do fancier early-fetching on important queries.
- `prepareReactRender`: Use before rendering React to trigger getting data.

## Client configuration

You can now configure options for the [core-client](/client/config) and [react integration](/react/config). A `retry` option allows for failed queries to retry automatically.

## File uploading

File uploading is now supported, see [here](/client/graphql-upload) for more.
